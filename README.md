# Music Recommendation System

ðŸŽ¶ðŸ”® Welcome to the Music Recommendation System using K-means Clustering! ðŸŽ§ðŸŽµ

This project aims to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening history and preferences. K-means clustering algorithm is employed to group similar users and identify music patterns, enabling the system to suggest tracks that align with the user's taste.

ðŸ“ŠðŸŽµ The system processes user listening data to create user clusters, and then recommends songs that are popular among similar clusters. This approach ensures that users receive relevant and diverse song suggestions, enhancing their music discovery experience.
